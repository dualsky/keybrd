The keybrd Wishlist
-------------------
16x16 matrix capability (10x11=110 keys on Teensy2)

Add keybrd matrix for PCA9655E-D I/O expander, and test on breadboard.

At this point the DodoHand firmware is usable enough for testing the hardware.
Further development will be easier once I access to the DodoHand hardware.
Add features to DodoHand sketch as described in the DataHand Pro II User Guide:
* Protected Mode
* NUM LOCK
* Sticky Mouse Buttons
* Double Strike
* LEDs
